## statement

A Tree component for Scala Swing. The original work was done by Ken Scambler and had subsequently been merged into
the [ScalaSwingContrib](https://github.com/benhutchison/ScalaSwingContrib) project. This is a fork from
ScalaSwingContrib that only retains the `Tree` class, making it again available as a standalone component, and
serving as a base for future improvements. The original code was released under a BSD style license.

All modifications (C)opyright 2013&ndash;2019 by Hanns Holger Rutz. New project released under the GNU LGPL v2.1+.
